database model --

   add new system_id table

       deployment_id INT,
       machine_id INT,
       system_id VARCHAR(255) not NULL
  
   deployment gets address field that includes address of last check in

shadowmanager svc task engine -- needs backend task engine with job id support.  

shadowmanger svc provisioning -- complete cobbler integration and also add a mechanism
for templating kickstarts (above and beyond Cobbler) that allows for install of
shadowvassal (see below), puppet, SSH key, and system ID in all provisioned systems.  
SSH infrastructure is the setup for shadowvassal.

shadowvassal -- add initd script to server that checks in via unauthed ping
to central server.  server runs shadowvassal by SSH, returns XML.  Initial infrastructure
by SSH until later (much later) QPID can be considered.  shadowvassal supports functions
like migrations and querying aspects of the system.   there is an analog to RHN system ID
stored on the system that uniquely identifies the system installed (which is also cached
in the shadowmanager svc database)

image import tool -- tool to import appliance definitions (maybe packaged as tar, XML, etc)
into the DB.  The idea is that the WUI will not contain knobs initially for configuring
the appliance though we'll ship with a few by default and make it easy for server admins
to install more definitions.

shadowmanager WUI -- support everything, and reduce user buttons, making it less of a CRUD
interface.  Add buttons for actions such as migrations/start/stop/etc.


puppet integration -- integrate shadowmanager backend with puppet, such that puppet is automatically provisioned
and configured, and that puppet manifests are configured to do the right thing.

OLDER MISC INFO

Backend
-------
- add an actions table
- add an API method to return status and return_data for a given job_id
- more validation code
- finish cobbler sync code (distro import already done)
- actions table and associated API changes.
- more backend methods (start/stop/VM/etc)
- RPM packaging
- install/upgrade process refinement/plan

WUI
---

- implement backend features listed above
- field validation on error (show why when error_fields are filled in)
- lookup tables for error messages, and select lists (architecture, etc.)
- RPM packaging
- Scott: fill in
