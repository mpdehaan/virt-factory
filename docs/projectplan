database model --

   add new system_id table

       deployment_id INT,
       machine_id INT,
       system_id VARCHAR(255) not NULL
  
   deployment gets address field that includes address of last check in

shadowmanager svc task engine -- needs backend task engine with job id support.  

shadowmanger svc provisioning -- complete cobbler integration and also add a mechanism
for templating kickstarts (above and beyond Cobbler) that allows for install of
shadowvassal (see below), puppet, SSH key, and system ID in all provisioned systems.  
SSH infrastructure is the setup for shadowvassal.

node control -- add initd script to managed node that checks in with central server.
backend code to manage nodes might be able to use the Kevin Smith XMLRPC-over-Jabber bus
for now, possibly.  Or just use variant of main backend code.

image import tool -- tool to import appliance definitions (maybe packaged as tar, XML, etc)
into the DB.  The idea is that the WUI will not contain knobs initially for configuring
the appliance though we'll ship with a few by default and make it easy for server admins
to install more definitions.

shadowmanager WUI -- support everything, and reduce user buttons, making it less of a CRUD
interface.  Add buttons for actions such as migrations/start/stop/etc.

puppet integration -- integrate shadowmanager backend with puppet, such that puppet is automatically provisioned
and configured, and that puppet manifests are configured to do the right thing.
