Ongoing TODO items (phase 1)

Backend
-------
- return types are always a hash, potential fields:
     return_data  : {}, [], or int
     stacktrace   : ""
     error_fields : {  "field1" : REASON_CODE, "field2" : REASON_CODE }
     job_id       : int
- add an actions table
- image "type" field gets renamed to is_container and made boolean
- machine "type" gets renamed by "valid_targets"
- more validation code
- finish cobbler sync code (distro import already done)
- single distro import (w/o rsync) for development
- actions table and associated API changes.
- more backend methods (start/stop/VM/etc)
- RPM packaging
- install/upgrade process refinement/plan
