Ongoing TODO items (phase 1)

Backend
-------
- return types are always a hash, potential fields:
     return_data  : {}, [], or int
     stacktrace   : ""
     error_fields : {  "field1" : REASON_CODE, "field2" : REASON_CODE }
     job_id       : int
- add an actions table
- add an API method to return status and return_data for a given job_id
- machine "distribution_id" field gets replaced with "image_id"
- machine "type" field gets renamed to is_container and made boolean
- image "type" field gets replaced with "valid_targets" (BAREMETAL,
  VIRT, or BAREMETAL_OR_VIRT) and boolean is_container. 
  is_container=true implies that valid_targets = BAREMETAL. These
  fields could possibly combined into one. 
- more validation code
- finish cobbler sync code (distro import already done)
- single distro import (w/o rsync) for development
- actions table and associated API changes.
- more backend methods (start/stop/VM/etc)
- RPM packaging
- install/upgrade process refinement/plan

WUI
---

- implement backend features listed above
- field validation on error (show why when error_fields are filled in)
- lookup tables for error messages, and select lists (architecture, etc.)
- RPM packaging
- Scott: fill in


General
-------

- How to handle migrations?
