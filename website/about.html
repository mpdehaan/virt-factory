<h2>About UMP</h2>
<h3>Introducing the next generation of systems management</h3>

<a href="img/screenshot_full.png"><img src="img/screenshot.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" /></a>

<p> There are many great and free and open source systems management tools -- perhaps too many.  As systems management choices are numerous and disparate, selecting which tools to use and how to connect them can become a time consuming process.</p>

<p> The Update &amp; Management Platform (UMP) is a software application framework for integrating systems management applications.  It's also a product.  Configuration management, provisioning, and update management come batteries included -- without time consuming setup and rewiring.  Other features can be swapped/in out over time, making it easy to incorporate the best features of other open source applications (such as your favorite monitoring stack) and choose the best options for a particular environment.
</p>

<p> For users, this means a well-integrated systems management solution with a common Web UI, command line scripting tools, and a uniform XMLRPC interface.  For infrastructure developers, struggling to deal with the cognitive dissonance of multiple systems management apps, it's one tool to unite them all.
