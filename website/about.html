<p>There are many systems management tools out there, including many great free and open source tools. These tools are numerous and disparate, however, making it a complex and time-consuming process to select which tools ot use and how to connect the pieces together.</p>

<p>By introducing a set of free and open source tools that adhere to the rules of a common and open platform, the Update &amp; Management Platform (UMP) will make it simpler for system administrators to choose and implement whichever management tools they desire.</p>
