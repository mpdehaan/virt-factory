<h3>The 'Component' Philosophy</h3>
<p>Virt-Factory is a <strong>platform</strong> upon which different tools may be developed and can then communicate with each other. This is because we understand that by nature system administration involves heterogeneous environments and a one-size-fits-all, monolithic approach to management tools does not work well in these environments.</p>
<p>Our goal is for this platform to be easily extensible, so that if it doesn't quite meet your needs in some way, you can easily add on whatever functionality you need to get your job done.</p>

<h3>The Components</h3>

<h4>Cobbler</h4>
<img src="img/logo-cobbler.png" />
<p>Cobbler is a <strong>Linux provisioning configuration tool</strong> that enables administrators to rapidly set up environments for (simultaneously) provisioning PXE, installing virtualized images, and re-provisioning existing machines. Set up of a PXE server, once a very manual process, is now greatly simplified. Cobbler also enables integrating virtualization into a PXE provisioning infrastructure and provides some interesting options to reinstall running machines as well.</p>
