<h3>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</h3>
<p>There are a couple of related IRC channels on <strong><a href="http://www.freenode.net/">irc.freenode.net</a></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>#virt-factory</strong> - for general virt-factory discussion.</li>
<li><strong>#cobbler</strong> - for discussion of <a href="components.php">cobbler</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p> If no one seems to be responding to your requests in IRC, feel free to ask your questions on the mailing list. (It's quite common for IRC users to 'idle' their nicks in a channel so they can catch up on any conversation they missed later on.)</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> irc.freenode.net has an IRC 'nick' (nickname, the name you go by in chat) registration system. Some irc.freenode.net channels require that you identify with the server every time you log in. This identification is also required for private messages on the network (no, they're not ignoring you; you probably just haven't identified with the registration system!) For more information, please consult <a href="http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#contents-userregistration">the Freenode Frequently-Asked Questions page on user registration</a>.</p>
