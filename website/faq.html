<a name="whatis">
<dt>What is UMP?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>UMP is a set of free and open source system management tools. The UMP platform is a free and open source platform upon which management tools can be built.

<a name="requirements">
<dt>What do I need to run UMP?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>UMP is currently supported on Fedora Core 6. Fedora 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 support will be released shortly.

<a name="stability">
<dt>How stable is UMP?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>UMP is currently an alpha-level project with a fast-paced rate of development.

<a name="architecture">
<dt>What kind of architecture does UMP have?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>UMP provides a central server for managing physical systems (including virtual hosts) and virtual guests. The server exposes an XMLRPC API that is used by the web user interface, and can also be used by custom scripts. On 'managed' systems, a special "node daemon" is installed, which is used to communicate with the central server over secure XMLRPC.

<a name="targetuser">
<dt>Who is the target user of UMP?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>We are currently targeting developers who want to be involved in new systems management technology as well as system administrators wishing to run a large number of virtual systems that have a key interest in virtualization and system recipes / appliance concepts.

<a name="virtualization">
<dt>How does UMP work with virtualization?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>Virtualization plays a core role in UMP and is heavily integrated. The software takes care of the nuts and bolts and can entirely manage your virtualization, though logging into virtualization via xm and virsh is still supported.

<a name="appliances">
<dt>How does UMP work with appliances?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>Appliances can be defined purely as metadata ('profiles') rather than binary blobs. The metadata describes the required virtual machine 9number of processors, memory etc.), the base system installation (as a kickstart file), and the appliance's 'personality' as a puppet manifest. this makes it possible to distribute appliances easily, and allows endusers to adapt appliances to their needs while still being able to consume appliance updates.

<a name="puppet">
<dt>How does UMP use puppet?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>Puppet is a core feature of our system recipes. Puppet is used to specify what a particular virtual or bare metal machine should have installed and how it is configured. However, since the puppet information is contained within the profile, it's not required that users of profiles have to understand Puppet. Authors of profiles definitely do though. We'll be working on more tools later, though cft is a great starting point.

<a name="deployment">
<dt>How are systems deployed using UMP?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>UMP uses cobbler as an internal library for provisioning. This means that if you have a datacenter and get new machines "off the truck", you'll be able to walk up to a machine and pick a "profile" for that machine to run, and provision it on the spot from a PXE menu. Virtualization management is there too. However, UMP takes over a cobbler server completely, so no knowledge of Cobbler or cobbler commands is required. In fact, you can't run UMP on your existing cobbler server. Sorry :)

<a name="monitoring">
<dt>What about monitoring?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>We'll be looking at adding some basic monitoring for our virt needs in a future release, although we're not trying to write any new monitoring frameworks at this point. The first release does not include monitoring, but you are more than welcome to specify monitoring setup in profiles that you deploy.

<a name="roadmap">
<dt>What about the future roadmap?</dt>
</a>
<dd>We want to break down the walls that currently control server deployment. We would like to be able to support tagging servers and deploying amongst arbitrary criteria, such that one would be able to say "I want 10 web servers on this network and they can run on any boxes with FOO and BAR capabilities". We also want to be more aware of storage configurations and support migrations. Eventually this can lead to more automated network policy management and SLA's -- but that's a ways off. There's lots of info on the Wiki here: <a href="http://et.redhat.com/page/VF_Roadmap">Roadmap</a>.

<a name="profile-build">
<dt>How do I build profiles (appliances)?</dt>
</a>
 <dd>Appliances are very simple. They are a tar.gz file in a certain format, with an xml manifest file, and directories for puppet files and manifests. We have documentation on the format (<a href="http://et.redhat.com/page/VF_Profile_Format">VF Profile Format</a>) and installation of downloaded profiles is covered in the install guide. (<a hre="http://et.redhat.com/page/VF_Install_and_Setup_Guide">VF Install and Setup Guide</a>).

<a name="contribute">
<dt>How can I contribute?</dt></a>
 <dd>Everyone is welcome. Share your ideas on the mailing list, ask questions, contribute patches. If you have ideas about appliance deployment and virtualization management, by all means, share them.
