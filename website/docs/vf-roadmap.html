<h3>0.0.4</h3>
</a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Use busrpc(AMQP) to communicate with nodes
</li>
<li>
Status tracking -- heartbeat from node daemons and associated infrastructure.  async notification of changes to Xen state show up in WUI, use AMQP to do this.
</li>
<li>
Keeping VM's (re)started when host nodes restart.
</li>
<li>
Seperate WUI from central server so they can optionally be installed on seperate machines.
</li>
<li>
Write the command line app ("ampm")
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>0.0.5</h3>
</a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Upload and import profiles via the WUI without using vf_import
</li>
<li>
Batch management via tasks and tag selection. (Do X to all machines tagged "foo" and "bar", look at all machines tagged "foo" and "bar", etc). 
</li>
<li>
A per host task view. Slice by hosts, see what each are doing. See what is going on in a specific host when you visit that page for the individual host.
Tracking of who/what initiated tasks when. (Audit logging). Show this when clicking on the task.
</li>
<li>
Better distro import interface (allow for running this at any time, not just startup).
</li>
<li>
Improve registration of virtual guests so hostnames and MAC data are always up to date.
Possibly register on each node daemon start?
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>0.0.6</h3>
</a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Tag management tools should be able to store the tags required to run a virtual machine, i.e. "lab4 storagepool5 fullvirtcapable" and be able to have a button to click on for a mahcine, that will allow all virtual deployments running on it to move to similarly tagged guests. These should be selected on an individual basis and can be overriden with non-similarly tagged guests as needed. Full Automation will come later.
</li>
<li>
Knowledge of basic storage information needed for migration.
</li>
<li>
Integration with basic monitoring information (something like SPECTRE) needed to develop automated "into the cloud" deployment heuristics. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Future / To Be Filed</h3>
</a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Automate cloud deployment and migration based on tags and basic resource availability.
</li>
<li>
Guard against unauthorized registration in the case of PXE (requires Cobbler voodoo).
</li>
<li>
Create more sample profiles -- (should move this up in priority)
</li>
<li>
API cleanup -- create higher level API more suitable for ISVs and sysadmins who want to integrate with VF. It's a bit low-level as it stands now, but workable.
</li>
<li>
Integrated Backup features
</li>
<li>
Make it easy to deploy RHX-type content as virtual appliance apps 
</li>
</ul>
