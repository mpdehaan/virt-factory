<h3>0.0.2 -- released 5/1</h3>
</a>
<p>
<pre>
Simplify the setup process. This is one of the most important things we need to do. --

* DVD imports + misc cobbler features (Michael, 7 days) -- OK
* automated puppet setup,  (Scott, 2 days) -- OK
* and automated vf_repo setup from something like on command. (Adrian 4, days) -- OK

Test PXE menu provisioning by profile, fix anything that comes up with kickstarts, registration, etc (Michael, 3 days) -- done

Change any prints to use log files. (Scott 1 day) -- done

Database upgrade support (Scott 5 days) -- OK

Have cobbler mirror extras (using reposync rather than rsync:// -- preferably with mirror-list awareness) to allow nodes to get things like puppet and koan -- rather important as this keeps node installs from working from PXE (or from cases where yum isn't accessible in non-PXE). This will become even more important as we move to having everything in extras. Once this is all done, finish PXE testing for registration hooks. (mdehaan, 3-4 days) -- done

Have registration ensure time is synced up for SSL purposes (sseago, ...) -- done, (NTP)

Have registration or node tool install configure iptables such that it allows puppet to go through (sseago) -- skipped?

More logging from register.py -- /var/log/virt-factory/register maybe. Right now there is no way to tell what happens during registration and failures are pretty easy given time issues, stopped services, etc (sseago) -- done

<h3>0.0.3</h3>
</a>
<p>
<pre>
(If anyone wants anything else, sign up)

Use busrpc(AMQP) to communicate with WUI, nodes, etc. -- alikins, ksmith (server-side); sseago (WUI side)

Further test infrastructure tweaks? -- alikins?

Minor architecture cleanup in modules as needed -- mdehaan, jortel?, others as needed

ORM usage and move to Postgres (possibly also support MySQL?). Database init scripts also. -- jortel, sseago

Work on new cobbler features (HW virt, other virt types, CD installs, better DHCP control) -- mdehaan, zeus

Work on jumpstarting [sic] channel/repo management project 'surfr' -- mmccune, ksmith

Incorporate shinier and better CSS/HTML/artwork (mostly done; minor CSS additions expected, and maybe some changes to the view/edit pages) -- mizmo, sseago, zeus (if needed)

Refactor vf_import to use puppet modules (done) -- sseago

Come up with plan for localization framework -- mmccune, ksmith, zeus

<h3>0.0.4</h3>
</a>
<p>
<pre>
Status tracking -- heartbeat from node daemons and associated infrastructure work to do that securely. Not to be confused with monitoring but may include what is accessible through libvirt, etc.

Keeping VM's started when host nodes restart and so on.

Display view cleanup, UI refinement, possible support for pagination for very large groups of machines.

Better integration with cobbler status tracking, etc. Watch provisioning status and make it visible in the WUI (mdehaan?)

Seperate WUI from central server so they can optionally be installed on seperate machines.

The Naming Question...

Integrate role/permission based control over what users can access what in the GUI. Specific use cases should be given so that starter roles can be established. This is probably not super-critical for initial release, so just having "Admin" and "Guest" for default roles may be enough. Consider support for authentication against other sources (LDAP) though do not require it.

<h3>0.0.5</h3>
</a>
<p>
<pre>
Upload and import profiles via the WUI without using vf_import

A per host task view. Slice by hosts. See what is going on in a specific host when you visit that page for the individual host.

Tracking of who initiated tasks. (Audit logging). Show this when clicking on the task.

Task error reporting (in GUI).... show why things fail and what state tasks are in better.

Batch management via tasks and tag selection. (Do this to all machines tagged "foo" and "bar").

Yum channel management. Be able to create new channels in the WUI and add software to it. This requires a fairly advanced channel module, so we might want to create this seperately and let stand-alone cobbler use it also. Also be able to mirror existing (external) content.

Fedora 7 support. How to select which distros to import?

<h3>0.0.6</h3>
</a>
<p>
<pre>
Ability to lock down channels (entitlements) for specific systems. May involve changing the way registration tokens work today.

Support for non-virtual clients running earlier RHEL. Associated package management support -- example: delivering ISV content. (Configure up2date for yum support?). Server software does need to support earlier editions.

Improve registration tool to store more inventory data about the system.

Improve registration tool to allow jailing of systems that do not have profile information contained in their registration token. Require that sysadmins approve the system and choose a profile. If using a regtoken, this would be automatically included and the step can be skipped.

Command line client -- ampm.

<h3>0.0.7</h3>
</a>
<p>
<pre>
Tag management tools should be able to store the tags required to run a virtual machine, i.e. "lab4 storagepool5 fullvirtcapable" and be able to have a button to click on for a mahcine, that will allow all virtual deployments running on it to move to similarly tagged guests. These should be selected on an individual basis and can be overriden with non-similarly tagged guests as needed. Automation will come later.

Knowledge of basic storage information needed for migration.

Integration with basic monitoring information (something like SPECTRE) needed to develop automated "into the cloud" deployment heuristics. 
</pre>

<h3>Future / To Be Filed</h3>
</a>
<p>
<pre>
Automate cloud deployment and migration based on tags and basic resource availability.

Run WUI on seperate server from management daemon

Guard against unauthorized registration in the case of PXE (requires Cobbler voodoo).

Create more sample profiles

API cleanup -- create higher level API more suitable for ISVs and sysadmins who want to integrate with VF. It's a bit low-level as it stands now, but workable.

Scaling

Backup features

Make it easy to deploy RHX-type content as virtual appliance apps
