Code based on MIT licensed code here http://erosson.com/migrate/trac/

This fork was made after list-announcement that the code was no longer maintained, and to
deal with build issues (the build scripts where hitting an egg server, which was causing
failures).

Migrate subdirectory code remains MIT, Virt-Factory is GPL and therefore compatible.
