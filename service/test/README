Test code for shadowmanager backend
----------------------------------

Basic idea:
	start up shadow.py on a non stock port pointing
	at a non stock db
	
	we can test "import" but need a way to test without
	doing a reimport everyime

	test cases will be though the xmlrpc interface

	each module will have it's own test case module

	need a way to run converage tests on the backend?


unit tests:
	we'll use some traditional unit tests for stuff
	like the logging module, etc.
