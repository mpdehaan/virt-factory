The busrpc module implements a tiered RPC mechanism: "local" which uses dbus as
the transport, and "remote" which uses AMQP (specifically QPID) as the
transport. As of this writing (5/7/07) only the local mechanism is fully
working. There are a few problems which need to be worked out before AMQP can
be integrated.

You'll need to have the following packages installed in order to use busrpc:

* python-simplejson
* dbus-python

You'll also need to symlink busrpc/src to
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/busrpc or make other arrangements to get
busrpc to show up on your PYTHONPATH.

Each instance of busrpc (one per machine) needs to have a RPC bridge running.
There's a bit of config which needs doing and a script to run:

* symlink busrpc/configs/system-local.conf to /etc/dbus-1/system-local.conf

* edit the above file to use your userid.
  Note: Yes, I know this is a kludgy and borked way to do this. This'll
        be cleaned up soon.

* Start the bridge by running the busrpc/scripts/start-bridge script

Demo code illustrating how to write servers and clients is in the busrpc/test
directory.
